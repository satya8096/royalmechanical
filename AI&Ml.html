                7) Answer: c <br><br>
                Explanation: It is categorized into 3 steps Sensing, Reasoning, Acting <br>
                i) Sensing: Through the sensor taking in the data about the world <br>
                ii) Reasoning: Reasoning is thinking or
                processing the data sensed by the sensor. <br>
                iii) Action: On the basis of input and reasoning, acting is generating and controlling actions in the environment.

                8) Answer: c <br><br>
    Explanation: The two main categorizations of AI are based on the capability and functionality. Based on capability it is divided into Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI). Based on functionality it is divided into reactive machines, limited memory, theory of mind, and self-awareness.

                9) Answer: a <br> <br>
    Explanation: Intelligence is intangible and is composed of mainly five techniques. Learning is the process of gaining knowledge by understanding, practicing, being taught, or experiencing one thing. Learning enhances the awareness of any topic, hence learning is one of the important components.
